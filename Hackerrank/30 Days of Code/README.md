#30 Days of Code

This is a repository to store the code which I will be writing as a part of [30 Days of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) project on Hackerrank.

I will be solving the problems of this project in both Python3 and Java. I have created separate folders for both of the programming languages.
